## overview
frontend experience for my tic tac toe ai using p5.js in place of React.js.

## app will allow users to:
* play against an ai with scalable difficulty
* receive suggestions for their "next move".

### to-do:
* implement scalable containers
* implement swipable containers that move along
    * x-only (slideshow)
    * x and y (dating apps)
* allow draggable containers to move as far as possible within the bounds of their parents (correct stopping behavior)
* figure out how to implement javascript bind(this) to allow for nested states
